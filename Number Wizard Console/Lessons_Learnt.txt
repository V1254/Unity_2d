- Setting up unity
- Switching to VS Code over Visual Studio for writing the scripts ~ and getting all necessary extensions to make life easier.
- Basics of C# (types, Creating functions (albeit very basic for now))
- Debug.log vs print:
    - print only works if the current class inherits from MonoBehaviour
- String interpolation can be achieved by appending $ to the start of the string, but used string.Format from my java background :P
    - E.g: Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {0}","World?")
